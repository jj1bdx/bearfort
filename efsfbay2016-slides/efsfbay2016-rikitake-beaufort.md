# Executive summary

* IoT is a buzzword: *back to basics*
* Designing fault-tolerant systems is *very hard*
* Practical way: more redundancy
* Devices/components *fail*
* Abstraction in Erlang helps a lot

---

# NOT in this talk (= ask other people)

* Protocols over TCP/IP: MQTT, CoAP
* Cryptographic security
* Host OS device drivers
* non-8bit Arduino boards
* Erlang/ALE (good for directly connecting devices to Raspberry Pi, but not for Arduino)

---

# In this talk

* Sensor basics
* Redundant sensors on (8-bit) Arduino
* Protocols on the wire
* Software development on Arduino
* How Erlang talks with Arduino
* Functional abstraction with Erlang
